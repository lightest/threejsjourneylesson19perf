# Three.js Journey lesson 19

Lesson 19 from beautiful Three.js-journey course by [@bruno_simon](https://twitter.com/bruno_simon), with improved performance.
This code emerged as a result of exploration how far it would be possible to push the performance using only techniques presented up untill lesson 19, without touching shaders.

Break down of the approach [in twitter thread](https://twitter.com/nikitayells/status/1638117324183023616).
